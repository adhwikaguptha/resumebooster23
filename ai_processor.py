JOB DESCRIPTION:
{job_description}

ORIGINAL RESUME:
{resume_text}

Important formatting instructions:
1. Keep ALL section HEADINGS in BOLD format (e.g., "SKILLS", "EXPERIENCE")
2. Keep ALL contact information and personal details unchanged
3. DO NOT add any introduction or conclusion text (like "Here is the rewritten resume...")
4. DO NOT include ANY symbols (*, +, â€¢, etc.) or formatting markers
5. DO NOT add any explanation text about how the resume was optimized

Make these strategic enhancements:
1. Add relevant missing skills that match the job description (if appropriate and truthful)
2. Apply custom NLP techniques:
   - Part-of-speech tagging to optimize verb usage (e.g., change "developed UI" to "UI Developer")
   - Semantic similarity matching for paraphrased matches (e.g., reword "built user dashboards" as "translated designs into code")
3. Enhance existing content with more impactful language:
   - Use stronger action verbs aligned with the job description
   - Add relevant industry keywords naturally throughout the text
   - Quantify achievements where possible (e.g., add percentages, metrics)
4. Improve section organization:
   - Place most relevant skills and experiences earlier in each list
   - Group related skills logically to improve readability
   - Maintain appropriate hierarchy within sections

The goal is to create a more optimized resume that:
- Preserves the original resume's core structure and truthful content
- Strategically enhances content to boost ATS matching score
- Maintains a professional, clean appearance with proper formatting
- Naturally incorporates relevant keywords without keyword stuffing
